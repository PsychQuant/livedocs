# Sign and notarize the CheLiveDocsMCP universal binary for outside-App-Store
# distribution.
#
# Why (#211): the released binary used to be ad-hoc signed. macOS TCC keys the
# Full Disk Access grant for an ad-hoc binary to its cdhash, so every version
# bump invalidated the grant and the user had to re-add the binary to the FDA
# list. A Developer ID Application signature makes TCC key the grant to the
# stable designated requirement (Team ID + signing identity), so it survives
# version bumps. That signature — not notarization — is what delivers the
# FDA-persistence #211 is about.
#
# Why notarize anyway: notarization matters for *quarantined-launch* paths — a
# browser download or the .mcpb (Claude Desktop) install, where Gatekeeper
# assesses the binary on first launch. The plugin wrapper's `curl` + `exec`
# path sets no com.apple.quarantine xattr, so Gatekeeper never fires there and
# an un-notarized (even ad-hoc) binary would exec identically. We notarize so
# the published release asset is safe to run by ANY means, not only the wrapper.
#
# Entitlements: Full Disk Access (kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles) is NOT a
# requestable entitlement (pure user grant). BUT this server controls Mail.app
# via Apple events, which a hardened-runtime process may not send without
# com.apple.security.automation.apple-events — so Entitlements.plist carries
# that key (#211 CODEX-1). Signing without it breaks all Mail AppleScript control.
#
# Stapling is NOT performed: stapler staple does not support raw Mach-O
# binaries (only .app/.pkg/.dmg). Gatekeeper online-checks at first launch
# instead — this requires the user's machine to be online once when first
# running the binary.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh <path/to/binary>
#
# Required env vars (no defaults — fork-friendly, no maintainer PII in errors):
#   DEVELOPER_ID    — codesigning identity, e.g. "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
#                     (a cert SHA-1 fingerprint also works)
#   NOTARY_PROFILE  — notarytool keychain profile name
#                     (set up via: xcrun notarytool store-credentials <name> ...)
#
# Optional env var:
#   ENTITLEMENTS    — entitlements .plist path (default:
#                     "Sources/CheLiveDocsMCP/Entitlements.plist"). If the file
#                     is absent the binary is signed with hardened runtime and
#                     no entitlements — sufficient for FDA.
